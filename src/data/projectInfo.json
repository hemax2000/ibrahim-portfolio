All this can be done by allowing the user to create a quiz in game-based form or non-game based and allowing participant to engage with the userâ€™s quiz. This project gives me more insight into back-end development. We developed it using Laravel, which, in my opinion, is one of the best languages for back-end development. The learning was somewhat easy, especially because I have some experience in PHP and the design starcture used is beautiful. I will undoubtedly use it in future projects.",
