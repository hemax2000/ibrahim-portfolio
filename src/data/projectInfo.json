It helps the user find movies based on genre and see their descriptions, banners, ratings on IMDB, and comments from other users on any movie. I mainly worked on the back-end and learned a lot about the back-end and PHP. The back-end was fascinating, and I really wanted to explore it further.",

All this can be done by allowing the user to create a quiz in game-based form or non-game based and allowing participant to engage with the userâ€™s quiz. This project gives me more insight into back-end development. We developed it using Laravel, which, in my opinion, is one of the best languages for back-end development. The learning was somewhat easy, especially because I have some experience in PHP and the design starcture used is beautiful. I will undoubtedly use it in future projects.",
